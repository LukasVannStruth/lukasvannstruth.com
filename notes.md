--- | --- | --- | ---
CSS | Bulma | <https://bulma.io/> | JS agnostic
Server | NGINX | <https://nginx.com> | Preferred over Apache because of small size/resource usage
JS | Angular | <https://angular.io> | Out of the big 3 frameworks if I'm gonna use one this is it.
Website Framework | Flask | <https://flask.pocoo.org> | The python framework that I'm gonna be using to build the site.
